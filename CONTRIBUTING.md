We're really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition. üëè

## Instructions

These steps will guide you through contributing to this project:

- Fork the repo
- Clone it and install dependencies

		git clone https://github.com/kbalagtey-tacit/responsive-image-utils
		npm install

Keep in mind that after running `npm install` the git repo is reset. So a good way to cope with this is to have a copy of the folder to push the changes, and the other to try them.

Make and commit your changes. Make sure the commands npm run build and npm run test:prod are working.

Finally send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/kbalagtey-tacit/responsive-image-utils/compare?expand=1) with a clear list of what you've done (read more [about pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)). Make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
